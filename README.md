# AmazonWebServerMenu
I created a user-friendly menu for all the functions of the program specified in the assignments.
The program is reusable as all the parameters are put in manually by the user such as: security groups, keys, names etc.
The program does the following : creates instances, lists instances, terminates instances, creates buckets, lists buckets, deletes buckets, puts an file onto a bucket, checks if the webserver has nginx installed and copies a index.html page to the nginx web server.
The code is user friendly and provides the user with usefull information.
